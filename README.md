## Codes
example code.m：example code.m builds an edge-center functional brain network for each participant and calculates node entropy.

enrom_boxlot.m：enrom_boxlot.m is a box diagram of different subnetwork entropies.

svm:svm is the two classifiers used to build MDD and MDDSI.

top10 important features :top10 important features is used to obtain the top 10 contribution features for each classifier.

PLS, PLS_bootstrap, PLS_calculate_stats, and PLS_candidate_genes；PLS, PLS_bootstrap, PLS_calculate_stats, and PLS_candidate_genesare used for subsequent transcriptional pattern analysis.
